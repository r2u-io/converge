R2U Converge is the metaverse where the barriers between the physical and the digital disappear.

In R2U Converge, consumers can shop real-world products, receive their NFTs on the blockchain, and build their dreamhouses in 3D. Creators can mint NFTs into any network they prefer and sell them directly to users and brands. Manufacturers and retailers can sell their physical and digital assets in a full 3D experience powered by the latest Web 3D and Augmented Reality technologies. Investors can take part in this universe by owning $R2U tokens, creating proposals, and voting on a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that defines how the community will evolve.
